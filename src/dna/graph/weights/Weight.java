/**
 * 
 * this class implements an abstract class for representing node and edge
 * weights. it provides general methods for generating (random) weights of
 * different types. a String representation of an instance can be created using
 * the asString() method. it is required that each weight implementation offers
 * a constructor that takes a single String parameter (the output from the
 * asString() and parses the weight from that). using the static
 * fromString(String str) method, weights can be generated from their respective
 * String representation. for generating (randomized) weights, different
 * selections can be used, some of them applicable only to specific types (e.g.,
 * int, double) others applicable to all weight types available (so far).
